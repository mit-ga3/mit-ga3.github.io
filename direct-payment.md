# MIT Direct Payment

## Buy-to-Pay - Amazon
If you order on Amazon through [Buy2Pay](http://buying.mit.edu/) then you do not need approval. Just please add the GA^3 Treasurer as an approver and email the GA^3 Treasurer to inform them of the purchase. Please **share the receipt with the treasurer** such that the purchase appears in GA^3's bookkepping and make sure to confirm that you received the order on Buy2Pay once it has come in.

## Buy-to-Pay (B2P) - Purchase Orders - Contact GA^3 Treasurer
A Purchase Order (PO) is used for goods and services - excluding travel - as a commitment to pay the vendor. PO's are not requests for a check payment. Please note, depending on the level of complexity in the PO, it could take anywhere from fifteen (15) business days to over forty-five (45) business days for it to be completed.

Purchase orders are used when:
* Total payment exceeds $5,000
* Is for a piece of equipment in excess of $3,000
* Total calendar year aggregate, in excess of $5,000
* Contracts need to be reviewed

Required Documents:
* Payments in excess of $10,000 must also have a filled out [Selection of Source Form](https://vpf.mit.edu/selection-of-source-form)
* A formal invoice (not a quote/estimate)
* Additional documents from vendor

## Contracts
When using a service of a person or company outside of MIT, use the [MIT Student Group Contract](https://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/files/MIT%20Student%20Group%20Professional%20Service%20Contract.pdf). Contracts are an important way for you to protect yourself, your group, and the Institute from possible liability resulting from an event. Contracts also serve as a standardized method of outlining what services a contract will provide to you or your group and the agreed upon remuneration.

Important Policies:
* __DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS__ on behalf of MIT. Your signature does not represent the Institute and all liability will fall on the unauthorized signatory.
* Student Group Contract - The Student Group Contract is effective immediately upon signature by the contractor. Only send to the vendor when the event is approved of by MIT and your student organization. This contract does not require a signature by MIT personnel.
* External Contracts - Should an outside organization require using their own (Non-MIT) contract, please allow at least fifteen (15) business days for review and an MIT signature. Contracts may require additional time for negotiation, so please begin this process as soon as possible. Examples include hotels, conference sites, and established performers. Contact the GA^3 Treasurer for assistance in beginning and managing this process.
