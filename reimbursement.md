# Reimbursement Instructions

## Step 0: Event Planning
* If you're planning the event, check the [Event Planner Checklist](./event-planner-checklist) before continuing.


## Step 1: Purchasing for an Event
* Receipts must be itemized, timestamped, and show proof of payment.
    * "Proof of payment" means the receipt states the items have been paid for by either cash/credit/debit (as opposed to a bill which just says how much is owed).
    * If "proof of payment" or any other required feature is missing on your reciept, please complete a [Missing Receipt Affidavit](https://web.mit.edu/lns/services/Missing_Receipt_Affidavit_0.pdf) and upload it alongside your receipt. 
* We cannot reimburse sales tax.
    * You can get the tax removed by presenting all three of [MIT's tax exempt forms](https://vpf.mit.edu/mits-state-sales-tax-exemptions) to the merchant.
* We cannot reimburse alcohol.
* If tipping, make sure you follow [OVC Tipping Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cbeyoK0fzLqHrLwqSlt6x83UE1Ga2ncS/view?usp=sharing). You will not be reimbursed for tips that exceed these guidelines.
* Do not use the same receipts for multiple RFPs.
* Your reimbursement will be directly deposited into the bank account you have on record with MIT (i.e. the same account you receive your bi-weekly graduate stipend).
    * If you are not paid by MIT (i.e. a visiting student) you will instead receive a check in the mail.
* If you are the event planner and using GSC funds, check if your event needs to be registered in Atlas ([instructions here](./register-event)).


## Step 2: Submit an RFP in Atlas
1. Go to: [https://atlas.mit.edu/](https://atlas.mit.edu/)
2. Click on "My Reimbursements" then "Request a Reimbursement for Me"
    * <div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">CAUTION: Don't open multiple RFPs in different tabs/windows simultaneously. The RFP website is buggy. This can causes the separate tabs/windows to corrupt each other!</div>
3. Fill out the "Request for Reimbursement (RFP)" according to the instructions specific to your reimbursement supplement:
    * [Personal food reimbursement for GA^3 Meeting ($18 max)](./ga3-meeting-food)
    * [Reimbursement for Graduate Student Meal Program](./gsm-program)
    * [GA^3 Event Reimbursement (e.g. food/equipment/fees for event)](./ga3-event)
    * [Mileage for GA^3 related event](./ga3-mileage)
    * [dREFS Event Reimbursement](./dREFS)
    * Anything else unclear? Email [ga3-treasurer@mit.edu](mailto:ga3-treasurer@mit.edu)
4. Click "Save & Continue"
5. Upload an itemized and readable picture or PDF of your receipt which also includes proof of payment
    * Pictures should be `.jpg` or `.png` (not `.webp` or `.heic`) and **no more than 2MBs**.
6. Upload a screenshot of the email or Slack message which publicly announced the event
    * Upload the email as a "receipt"
    * The screenshot must specifically reference the date and time of the meeting (i.e. an email for a reoccuring meeting is not sufficient)
7. Send the RFP to the appropriate finanical officer:

| Name | Kerberos | Condition |
| ---- | -------- | --------- |
| _tba_ | _tba_ | **ONLY** for GSM Community Meals |
| Patrick Riley | pdriley | **ONLY** for Executive Committee Meeting |

CAUTION: Keep the RFP Confirmation screen open! You will need to copy information out of this screen. If you mistakenly close it, there are instructions on how to reopen it in the next step.
</div>

## Step 3: GA^3 Reimbursement Google Form
1. Complete [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/URog4LprTQhmz1r38) by copying over the requested information from your completed RFP.

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
INFO: If you mistakenly closed your RFP, you can reopen it by:
<ol>
<li>Go to: <a href="https://atlas.mit.edu/">https://atlas.mit.edu/</a></li>
<li>Click on "My Reimbursements" then "My Reimbursement Inbox"</li>
<li>Select the RFP of interest to reopen it</li>
<li>After reviewing the RFP in your inbox, forward it again to the appropriate finanical officer. Viewing the RFP can recall it from the forwarded party's inbox.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
INFO: If your RFP has multiple line items with the same Cost Object and Sub-Budget Code (even if G/L Account is different), you only need to submit a single Google Form. If this is the case, enter the total RFP value into the Google Form and the G/L Account for the largest expense. 
</div>

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
CAUTION: If the Cost Object or Sub-Budget Code differs between line items, you must submit separate Google Forms for each.
</div>

## Step 4: Tracking your Reimbursement
1. Go to: [https://atlas.mit.edu/](https://atlas.mit.edu/)
2. Click on "My Reimbursements" then "Track My Reimbursements"
3. A summary of all your unpaid RFPs will be shown
    * You can also see your paid RFPs from up to the last 90 days under "Select RFPs to display"

## RFP Rejections

* If your RFP gets rejected, it will be returned to your RFP Inbox with a note indiciating the issue.
* To resubmit your RFP:
    1. Correct the error.
    2. Resend the the RFP to the appropriate finanical officer.
    3. Resubmit [the Google Form](https://forms.gle/URog4LprTQhmz1r38).
* To prevent your RFP from getting rejected again, make sure you do **ALL THREE** of the above steps.

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
INFO: We know getting your RFP sent back can be frustrating, but please don't take it personally!

This paperwork needs to be completed in a very specific (and admittedly pedantic) manner. This is to ensure MIT's financial procedures are followed and our internal GA^3 budget parsing system works.
